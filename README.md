# Nifi-Utils-Chrome-Extension
This extension eases the process of maintaining huge production nifi instances with numerous flows.

By using this extension you can :

1. Fetch a list of all the process groups visible on the current Nifi page, and the process groups list will be cached for later.
2. After fetching the list of process groups, they can be sorted based on the running, stopped, invalid and disabled counts within each process group.
3. You can bookmark the process groups you want to visit later by adding them to the queue.
4. All of the process groups available on the current Nifi page can be added to the queue, and then can be copied into a spreadsheet.
5. Process groups can be searched right inside the extension, and the search results will be cached for later.
6. A few custom UI elements can be added onto Nifi UI for copying JWT token directly to clipboard, enabling and disabling controller services.
